Welcome to this demo app that highlights various ways you can work with Linked Data (aka [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/), aka semantic data) using
JavaScript libraries.

In this demo we make use of [LDO](https://github.com/o-development/ldo/), [rdflib.js](https://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js/), and [Inrupt JavaScript Client Libraries](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/). For each
we've implemented the same feature - a simple form that changes your name in your Solid WebID profile. This means that
they require you to authenticate with a Solid WebID.

<div className="message is-warning">
    <div className="message-body">
        If you don't have a Solid WebID, you might want to [select a Pod
        provider](https://solidproject.org/users/get-a-pod#get-a-pod-from-a-pod-provider). If you don't know what Solid
        is, you might want to check out [the Solid project](https://solidproject.org/).

Please click onto one of the libraries listed below to see how the feature is implemented in that library. You can also
navigate to the libraries via the navigation at the top.
