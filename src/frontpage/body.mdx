In this demo we make use of [LDO](https://github.com/o-development/ldo/), [rdflib.js](https://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js/), and [Inrupt JavaScript Client Libraries](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/). For each
we've implemented the same feature - a simple form that changes your name in your Solid WebID profile. This means that
they require you to authenticate with a Solid WebID. If you're not sure what that means, you might want to read up
on [the Solid project](https://solidproject.org/about).

Please click onto one of the libraries to see how the feature is implemented in that library. You can also navigate to
the libraries via the navigation at the top.
