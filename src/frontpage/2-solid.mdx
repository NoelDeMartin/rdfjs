In the first demos we've focused on working locally in the browser by storing our data in cookies. But semantic data is
designed to live on the web, so to not take that aspect into mind is flawed. The problem with this approach is that it
requires us to synchronize our data with a web server. Meaning we need some sort of authorization on the resources
involved, which in turn probably would require some authentication.

Luckily, all of this is solved by using Solid! As promoted on [solidproject.org](https://solidproject.org/):

<blockquote>
    Solid is a specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called Pods.
    Pods are like secure personal web servers for data. When data is stored in someone's Pod, they control which
    people and applications can access it.
</blockquote>

We've created two more demos, using rdflib.js and LDO again, but this time with Solid in mind. This means that the demos
require you to authenticate, and the name you change is the one connected to your WebID profile.
