Rdflib.js is probably _the_ longest ongoing project that allow developers to manage RDF. It's used in many projects,
such as [the SolidOS project](https://github.com/SolidOS/solidos). Its API is mostly low-level, requiring you to
understand quite a bit of RDF to use it. I would also argue that the form of some of the functions are outdated, such
as `serialize` where the last parameter is a callback function. This eludes back to how callbacks were handled before
promises were a thing in the JS-community.

The API is extensive, and should have you covered in most situations. But it's dated and low-level API makes me not
enjoying my work with it, and in general I would recommend _not_ using it for front-end projects.
