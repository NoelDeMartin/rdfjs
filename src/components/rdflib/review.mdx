        The API is extensive, and should cover most of your RDF-related needs. It has limited
        [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) support, allowing a subset of queries. That said, working with
        rdflib.js' API nowadays feels antiquated, and I've always had to struggle to make it work with state-management
        libraries like React.

        The documentation is useful, but it's not complete and a bit hard to navigate at times. Also, the project can
        be confused by [Python's rdflib](https://pypi.org/project/rdflib/) when using a search engine, especially if
        you're new to RDF, which is less than ideal.

        The community for rdflib.js is lacking, but there are people out there that will step in to help if you have
        problems (usually through channels like
        [linkeddata/rdflib.js](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#linkeddata_rdflib.js:gitter.im)). The library has had
        many developers throughout the years (myself included), and some of these will pitch in when needed.

        Although the response can be good, and the people welcoming, the code base of rdflib.js is quite hard to manage
        at times. This means that bug can take a long time to be fixed. Luckily, the library has been out for a long
        time, and it has proven reliable in preserving it's APIs.
