        The API is extensive, and should cover most of your RDF-related needs. It has limited
        [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) support, allowing a subset of queries. That said, working with
        rdflib.js' API nowadays feels antiquated, and I've always had to struggle to make it work with state-management
        libraries like React.

        The documentation is useful, but it's not complete and a bit hard to navigate at times. Also, the project can
        be confused by [Python's rdflib](https://pypi.org/project/rdflib/) when using a search engine, especially if
        you're new to RDF, which is less than ideal.

        The community for rdflib.js is not very active, but there are people out there that will step in to help if you
        have problems (usually through channels like
        [linkeddata/rdflib.js Matrix chat](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#linkeddata_rdflib.js:gitter.im)). The library
        has had many developers throughout the years (myself included), and some of these will pitch in when needed.

        Although the response can be good, and the people welcoming, the code base of rdflib.js is quite hard to manage
        at times. This means that bug can take a long time to be fixed. Luckily, the library has been out for a long
        time, and it has proven reliable in preserving it's APIs.

        rdflib.js is probably the oldest JavaScript library that supports RDF. Hence, it's sports a test and tried API
        that you can be sure have most bugs discovered.

        rdflib.js offers a robust experience that allows you to engage with RDF in a low-level manner. It requires you
        to know how RDF works to use it, but rewards you with an stable and safe API. In my opinion the API also suffers
        from its age, most prominently shown in asynchronous functions like `parse` and `serialize` that relies on
        callbacks. It's philosophy on having a global store is also not necessarily aligned with component-specific
        scopes, but since it's forced upon you, it's not a big problem.

        I <u>**would use**</u> rdflib.js if you're dependent on a stable library with a low-level API plus some helper
        utility for online features. I <u>**would not use**</u> it in most web apps since it forces you to get into the
        nitty gritty of low-level RDF data management.
