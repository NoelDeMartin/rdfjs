    Hopefully this has given you an idea for what ShEx can do for you. There is a lot more that it supports, such as the
    `+` cardinality token (meaning one or more), the referral to shapes (even itself) to create a tree of shapes, nested
    properties, and more.

    I encourage you to check out the [official website](https://shex.io/) first and foremost to learn more about ShEx,
    but there are other resources I can recommend as well.
