    This demo saves the underlying turtle in `localStorage`. It no turtle is found, a default one is used:

                The type of objects that we usually start with is `SolidDataset` from the
                [resource/solidDataset](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/api/javascript/solid-client/modules/resource_solidDataset.html)
                module. We also prepare a turtle string since we're working locally.

            </td>
            <td>
                We also set up the variables `profile` and `name`, which respectively represent the thing retrieved as
                profile and the literal name. The latter is important to pass on for the `Demo` component we fetch the
                profile from the dataset that's currently used.

            <td>
                @inrupt/solid-client doesn't provide all the tools necessary for loading a turtle locally, so we've made
                use of [N3.js](https://github.com/rdfjs/N3.js) to parse the turtle string. Since N3 returns [RDF/JS
                Dataset](https://rdf.js.org/dataset-spec/), we can parse it using `fromRdfJsDataset`.

            <td>
                <Content>
                    Since parsing the initial turtle string can take a little time, we show the `Loading` component
                    while we wait for it to complete and update the dataset. Usually this goes very fast though.

                    Do note that the error handling here is bad, since there are changes that the dataset or profile
                    turns up `null`. But I've simplified the code for readability, so I accept this flaw.

                When submitting we get get thing we want to update, the profile, and update the literal that was set for
                `foaf:name`. We then update the dataset with the updated thing, and proceed to serialize the updated
                dataset, again with the help of N3.js.
