<AuthorNote title="I like TypeScript">
    As I mentioned, I enjoy coding with TypeScript. I'll use it in most of my projects, if not all. This website is not
    an exemption. So even if you're amongst those that despise TypeScript or find it unnecessary, I hope you find value
    in the code I share ^_^
