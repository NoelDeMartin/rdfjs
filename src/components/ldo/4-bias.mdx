<AuthorNote title="My bias with LDO">
    As you have probably understood by now, I'm quite fond of LDO. Although I won't say I'm overly biased, there is the
    fact that I know Jackson Morgan and consider him a Solid friend (dum-dum-tsh). We're former colleagues from my time
    in Inrupt, and we've worked together here and there.

    That said, I will say that my fondness of LDO comes from the API. I'm very much in love with the expressiveness and
    power that it provides, and I hope to see more greatness come from the [LDO
    project](https://github.com/o-development/ldo/).
