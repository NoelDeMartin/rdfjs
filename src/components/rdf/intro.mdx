    [you](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/)
    [started](https://rdf.js.org/) (and I do encourage you to check them out), but for the purpose of this website I'll
    give you a quick introduction to what RDF is all about.

    RDF is an abbreviation for Resource Description Framework. It's a framework for representing information on the web.
    It's a semantic technology in that its fundamental building stone, the triple, is based of the human language. This
    allows us to express relationships using human language, where entities such as persons can be represented as nodes
    and the relationships going from one to the other as edges. These directed graphs are what we call RDF graphs. They
    describe a set of statements, which themselves consists of three parts - a triple. These parts are the Subject, the
    Predicate, and the Object.

    A classic depiction of this is:

    <picture className="image">
        <img src="/triple.png" style={{height: 66, width: "auto"}}
             alt={`A diagram representing a triple with the Subject, the Predicate, and the Object.`}/>
    </picture>

    Another important feature of RDF is that nodes and edges are IRIs (similar to URLs) that represent them, and all
    denoted things have unique IRIs. So another way of expressing the depiction above is with text:

<Code code={textTurtle} id="textTurtle" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>

    This statement is expressed using [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/), one of many serializations of RDF.
    There's also [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), [RDFa](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-primer/), and
    [RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/) amongst the popular ones (although we rarely speak of the
    latter one).

    After RDFs initial conception in 1999 it has had multiple extensions, and we now have ways of describing
    vocabularies, logical relationships, and infer new knowledge based on the given set of data. This might seem little,
    but it opens up for a lot of powerful technologies, such as
    [triplestores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore),
    [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL), and [Solid](https://solidproject.org/). And it's inherent nature to
    the web should make it a perfect match for JavaScript, a programming language that has had its childhood on the web,
    and keeps achieving great strides on the web today. But there's an inherent conflict with RDF and JavaScript...

    <h2 className="subtitle">The inherent problem with RDF and JavaScript</h2>

    <p><strong>JavaScript has no native interface for RDF!</strong></p>

    Unlike another data structure, JSON, JavaScript simply don't talk triples.
