    [you](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/)
    [started](https://rdf.js.org/) (and I do encourage you to check them out), but for the purpose of this website I'll
    give you a quick introduction to what RDF is all about.

    RDF is an abbreviation for **Resource Description Framework**. It's a framework for representing information on the
    web. It's a semantic technology in that its fundamental building stone, the triple, is based of the human language.
    This allows us to express relationships using human language, where entities such as persons can be represented as
    nodes and the relationships going from one to the other as edges. These directed graphs are what we call RDF graphs.
    They describe a set of statements, which themselves consists of three parts - a triple. These parts are the Subject,
    the Predicate, and the Object.

    A classic depiction of this is:

    <picture className="image">
        <img src="/triple.png" style={{height: 66, width: "auto"}}
             alt={`A diagram representing a triple with the Subject, the Predicate, and the Object.`}/>
    </picture>

    Another important feature of RDF is that nodes and edges are IRIs (similar to URLs) that represent them, and all
    denoted things have unique IRIs. So another way of expressing the depiction above is with text:

<Code code={textTurtle} id="textTurtle" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>

    This statement is expressed using [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/), one of many serializations of RDF.
    There's also [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), [RDFa](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-primer/), and
    [RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/) amongst the popular ones (although we rarely speak of the
    latter one).

    After RDFs initial standardization in 1999 it has had multiple extensions, and we now have ways of describing
    vocabularies, logical relationships, and infer new knowledge based on the given set of data. Vocabularies allow us
    to formally agree on terms, and with those terms we can make sure that our data is understood by multiple apps. With
    that we get projects like [schema.org](https://schema.org/), maybe worlds largest vocabulary. We can also share data
    more easily, as shown by the [Linked Open Data Cloud](https://lod-cloud.net/).

    This might seem little, but it opens up for a lot of powerful technologies, such as
    [triplestores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore), [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL), and
    [Solid](https://solidproject.org/). There's also lovely technologies such as shapes, where you have
    [SHACL](https://shacl.org/) and [ShEx](http://shex.io/) as the most promising technologies. (Make a note of the
    latter, it will resurface on the page on <NavLink to="/ldo">LDO</NavLink>.)

    It's inherent nature to the web should make RDF a perfect match for JavaScript, a programming language that has had
    its childhood on the web, and keeps achieving great strides on the web today. But there's an inherent conflict with
    RDF and JavaScript...

    <h2 className="subtitle">JavaScript has no native interface for RDF</h2>

    <picture className="image gif">
        <img src="/shock.jpg" style={{height: 200, width: "auto"}} alt={`A cartoon-like cat being seemingly shocked`}/>
    </picture>

    Unlike JSON that enjoys being a first class citizen, JavaScript simply don't talk triples. So we have to construct
    systems to manage the data as if we were working with a graph, and APIs to interact with this graph, all in a
    language that don't support it.

    Luckily there are heroes out there who takes on this challenge. And we now have multiple ways of managing our data.

    But alas, my train of thought went astray with the thought of JavaScript. Lets return to exploring RDF.
