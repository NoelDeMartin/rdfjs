    <h2 className="subtitle">Querying</h2>

    An important feature of any data model is the ability to query, either for specific data points or relationships.
    The most advanced querying language of RDF is [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/), which has a
    wide set of query capabilities. I've written a <NavLink to={"/sparql"}>small guide</NavLink> on it, but you are
    probably better off learning more about SPARQL elsewhere (it's not my speciality).
