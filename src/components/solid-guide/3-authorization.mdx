    <h2 className="subtitle">Authorization</h2>

    Authorization is another vital pillar of Solid. It is what connects the user with the control of resources.
    Currently there are two standards in the works describing authorization controls for Solid, [Web Access
    Control (WAC)](https://solidproject.org/TR/wac) and [Access Control Policy
    (ACP)](https://solid.github.io/authorization-panel/acp-specification/). Going into details in either is beyond the
    scope of this website.

    As a general rule you can consider WAC a more stable specification, that's implemented on more servers. ACP on the
    other hand provides more features that are required for larger use-cases, and is experimented on using Inrupts'
    [Enterprise Solid Server (ESS)](https://www.inrupt.com/products/enterprise-solid-server).
