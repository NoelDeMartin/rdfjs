    <h2 className="subtitle">Authorization</h2>

    Authorization is another vital pillar of Solid. It is what connects the user with the control of resources.
    Currently there are two standards in the works describing authorization controls for Solid, [Web Access
    Control (WAC)](https://solidproject.org/TR/wac) and [Access Control Policy
    (ACP)](https://solid.github.io/authorization-panel/acp-specification/). Going into details in either is beyond the
    scope of this website.

    *As a side-note though:* An important feature that we can take away from them both is the access modes `READ`,
    `WRITE`, `APPEND`, and `DELETE`. The specifics of these might vary, but for the purpose of this website they mean
    the following:

    * `READ`: Being able to access a resource and its content. In the case of containers it's debated whether you should
    see children who themselves has access controls denying user `READ` access.
    * `WRITE`: Being able to write to a resource, and in the case of containers, create new resources within them.
    * `APPEND`: Being able to append but not remove existing data. In the case of containers, you're able to create
    a resource, but not necessarily write to it afterwards. This mode allows you to have, say, an inbox, where outsiders
    can post messages, but not see other messages.
    * `DELETE`: This access allows you to delete something explicitly (e.g. you cannot access its content, which `READ`
    or `WRITE` would give)

    These concepts are not important to understand to use this website, but they are useful fundamentals when reading
    up on authorization.
