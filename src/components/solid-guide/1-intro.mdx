    Let's start with the description of Solid published by [solidproject.org](https://solidproject.org/):

    <blockquote cite="https://solidproject.org/">
        Solid is a [specification](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol) that lets people store their data
        securely in decentralized data stores called Pods. Pods are like secure personal web servers for data. When data
        is stored in someone's Pod, they control which people and applications can access it.
    </blockquote>

    Now, although Solid is technically "just" a specification, it's usually used to describe the community surrounding
    it, including the process that has evolved with the community through years. The Solid community has grown into a
    complex being, with a lot of forces pulling into various directions, but they're united in the goal of making Solid
    a viable standard for decentralized data. I've listed a couple of resources on various Solid community tools, like
    chats and various projects.
