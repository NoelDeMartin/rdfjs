    <h2 className="subtitle is-4">Apps</h2>

    Lastly there's the term "Solid apps", which describe applications that are compatible with the Solid specification.
    This website is in fact a Solid app, since it allows you to authenticate with your Solid account and manipulate data
    in your WebID profile.

    Apps are arguably the most important part of the Solid ecosystem, as it is *the interface* that users will use to
    interact with said ecosystem. But whatever part is the most important, it is the total sum of all these parts that
    turns Solid into a powerful infrastructure, ripe with potential to be unleashed by social-minded developers.

    Ok, this is turning a bit into a fluff-piece. But just to emphasize: *Solid is really great, and you should be
    excited about it!* Ok, there, I'm done ^_^
