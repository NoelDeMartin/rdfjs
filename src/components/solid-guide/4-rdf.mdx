    <h2 className="subtitle">RDF</h2>

    The third and arguable last pillar, RDF, is perhaps the most important pillar for Solid. Solid actually used to be
    an acronym for Solid Linked Data (and some still write it as SoLiD), and it is also arguably the next iteration of
    what was known as the Semantic Web. By focusing on the personal use of Linked Data, Solid brings the power of RDF
    directly to the users.

    This, in combination with the authentication and authorization parts make up Solid, and is the foundation that we
    can build apps that empowers our users. By allowing our users to fully control the data, and remembering the
    privilege it is to actually be able to access their data and hopefully make their lives better.

    RDF allows us to formally define vocabularies for the data we manage for our users, to share this knowledge with
    other app developers who want to enhance the work we've put in for our users. And by using shapes we can share
    knowledge about the specifics of how we expect our data to look, and make sure that our apps stay interoperable with
    each other.

    All of this is technically possible, but socially hard to implement. And it seems to me that its success hinges on
    the work of its community, that we are able to cooperate in a way that empowers our users and the data we are
    allowed to manage for them.
