Welcome to this demo app that highlights various ways you can work with Linked Data (aka [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/), aka semantic data) using
JavaScript libraries.

We'll start by showing how RDF can be manipulated locally by using [LDO](https://github.com/o-development/ldo/) or
[rdflib.js](https://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js/). For each library we've implemented the same feature - a simple form
that takes your name and saves it to local storage when you submit the form.

Please click onto one of the libraries listed below to see how the feature is implemented in that library. You can also
navigate to the libraries via the navigation at the top.
