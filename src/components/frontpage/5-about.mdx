    <h2 className="subtitle is-3">About this website</h2>

    This website is created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/), and
    [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). It's written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
    [TSX](https://react.dev/learn/typescript), and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). For authentication in the Solid demos I've
    made use of [@ldo/solid-react](https://github.com/o-development/ldobjects/tree/main/packages/solid-react) and
    [@inrupt/solid-client-authn-core](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn-js).

    The code is available on [the project's GitHub repo](https://github.com/megoth/semtechjs-demo).

            This website is created in the hopes of providing an educative platform for choosing a library when one
            wants to work with [Linked Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data). I've worked with this since I
            wrote my [Master Theses](https://graphitethesis.icanhasweb.net/) back in 2012, and although there are some
            gaps in how much I've been able to invest in the matter, I feel confident in expressing my opinions.

            I hope you're able to find value in these writings, and that we can have a productive discussion on how
            to improve educational tools like this for users. Connect with me via [issues on the project's GitHub
            repo](https://github.com/megoth/semtechjs-demo/issues) to start that discussion.
