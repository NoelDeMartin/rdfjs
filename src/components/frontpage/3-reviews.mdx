<h2 className="subtitle is-3">Which library should you use?</h2>

<Content>
    If there was an easy answer to this question, I wouldn't feel the need to make a website like this. Each
    library has their pros and cons, and in the end the choice comes down to a set of personal and project specific
    preferences.

    I will do my best to present each library as simply as possible, using a very simple demo setup to demonstrate their
    capabilities. That said, the demos are simple and they cannot show the full feature set of each library. The demos
    are but a taste of each library, and to fully know their capacities, you need to check their documentation (which
    I will link to).

    Although I cannot fully convey everything that the libraries, I can convey my impressions of them, and in which
    situations they excel (and in which they lack). For each demo I break down my impressions into the following
    categories:

    - **API usability:** How does the library allow the developer to approach the problem? How easy is the API to get
    into, to get something done quickly, and then move on to other problems that need fixing? Is it prone to bugs? Does
    it guide developers to handle edge cases in a intuitive manner?
    - **Documentation quality:** How accessible is it to developers who need to find some fix? Does it rank high when
    people search for help using their library?
    - **Community:** Is there an active community that helps developers in need? Do they have community or contribution
    guidelines?
    - **Maturity:** How widely is the library used, and is it being actively developed? What is the track record for
    handling updates and hot fixes (if ever needed).

    I will also give a five-score rating, going from 1 <Rating rating={1} /> to 5 <Rating rating={5} /> for each
    category.
