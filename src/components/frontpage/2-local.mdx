    </h2>

    I'll start by showing how RDF can be manipulated locally in your browser by using three of the libraries
    (rdflib.js, LDO, and Soukai). For each library I've implemented the same feature - a simple form that takes your
    name and saves it to local storage when you submit the form. The demo will then retrieve that name when the demo is
    later reloaded.

    Please click onto one of the demos listed below to see how the feature is implemented in that library. You can
    also navigate to the demos via the libraries listed at the top.
