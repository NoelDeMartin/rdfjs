    <h2 className="subtitle is-3">How does the demo work?</h2>

    All of the demos use the same component, The `Demo` component. It takes two arguments, `name` and `onSubmit`. The
    component presents a form with one simple text input. This input presents the name that is given to the user. The
    form can be submitted, at which point the function `onSubmit` will be called.

    The demo below will not store anything, so refreshing the webpage will reset all changes.

<FrontpageDemo/>

<Content>
    This code is written in [TSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html), a language that combines
    Typescript and ESM files. It's specifically written with React in mind, and relies a lot on [React
    Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react). That said, I think the overall abstractions are clear, and I'll walk
    through the various parts:

            <td>

            <td>
                We're making use of [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/)'s `useForm`.
                The `FormData` interface only has one attribute: name. This hook provides us with functionality that
                manages the data flow of the form element at line 33. Also note `useEffect` at line 21, that updates the
                value of name in the form if name is updated elsewhere.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><CodeLink id="FrontpageDemoCode" lines={["18", "28"]}>Notifications</CodeLink></td>
            <td>Whenever the name successfully submits, we want to notify the user.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <CodeLink id="FrontpageDemoCode" lines={["19", "24-27", "41"]}>Throttling submits</CodeLink>
            </td>
            <td>
                Whenever we're working with the Solid demos, there might be a delay when communicating with the Solid
                servers. Given this behavior, I want to limit when a user can submit updates.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><CodeLink id="FrontpageDemoCode" lines={["16", "26"]}>Relaying submits</CodeLink></td>
            <td>
                We pass the data submitted to the parent demo code, which provide the specific logic that should
                be done when form is submitted.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </Walkthrough>

        The important part of all of this is that `name` is actually handled in the parent element, which is where the
        logic of the demo resides (and which I'll show in the respective code section). It basically only provides a
        form that calls on `onSubmit` when submitted.
