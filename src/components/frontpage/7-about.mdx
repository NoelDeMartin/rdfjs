    <h2 className="subtitle is-3">About this website</h2>

    This website is created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/), [React
    Router](https://reactrouter.com/), and [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/). It's design is composed
    using [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/),
    and [Prism](https://prismjs.com/). It's written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
    [TSX](https://react.dev/learn/typescript), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), and [CSS
    Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). For authentication in the Solid demos I've made use of
    [@ldo/solid-react](https://github.com/o-development/ldobjects/tree/main/packages/solid-react) and
    [@inrupt/solid-client-authn-core](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn-js).

    The code is available on [the project's GitHub repo](https://github.com/megoth/semtechjs-demo).

            I've created this website in the hopes of providing an educative platform for choosing a library when one
            wants to work with [Linked Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data). I've worked with this since I
            wrote my [Master Theses](https://graphitethesis.icanhasweb.net/) back in 2012, and although there are some
            gaps in how much I've been able to invest in the matter, I feel confident in expressing my opinions.

            I'm a moderator at [Solid Community Forum](https://forum.solidproject.org/u/megoth) and
            [r/solid](https://www.reddit.com/r/solid), and interact with the Solid community from time to time. I've
            worked at [Inrupt](https://www.inrupt.com/) for four years, and am currently working as a [Senior Consultant
            at Capgemini - Insights and Data](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnehassel/).

            I hope you're able to find value in these writings, and that we can have a productive discussion on how
            to improve educational tools like this for users. If you have any issues with the content, please contact
            me via [issues on the project's GitHub repo](https://github.com/megoth/semtechjs-demo/issues).
