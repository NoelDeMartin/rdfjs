In the first demos we've focused on working locally in the browser by storing our data in cookies. But semantic data is
designed to live on the web, so to not take that aspect into mind is flawed. The problem with this approach is that it
requires us to synchronize our data with a web server. Meaning we need some sort of authorization on the resources
involved, which in turn probably would require some authentication.

Luckily, all of this is solved by using Solid! As promoted on [solidproject.org](https://solidproject.org/):

<div className="message is-info">
    <div className={"message-body"}>
        Solid is a specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called Pods.
        Pods are like secure personal web servers for data. When data is stored in someone's Pod, they control which
        people and applications can access it.
    </div>
</div>

When working with Solid, we want to present three libraries. Rdflib.js can be used here too, and while LDO can too,
we've opted to use the [@ldo/solid-react](https://github.com/o-development/ldo/tree/main/packages/solid-react) package
which integrates nicely with Solid and React. Lastly, we've included
[Inrupt's JavaScript client libraries](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/) as well,
since it provides an interesting alternative to working with RDF and Solid.
