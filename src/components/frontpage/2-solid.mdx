    In the first series of demos I've focused on working locally in the browser by storing the data in local storage.
    But Linked Data is designed to live on the web and be, well, linked! The problem with this approach is that it
    requires us to synchronize our data with a web server. Meaning we need some sort of authorization on the resources
    involved, which in turn probably would require some authentication.

    Luckily, all of this is solved by using Solid! As promoted on [solidproject.org](https://solidproject.org/):

        Solid is a specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called Pods.
        Pods are like secure personal web servers for data. When data is stored in someone's Pod, they control which
        people and applications can access it.

    Do note that even though I've chosen Solid for these demos, most of these should also work nicely with other
    Linked Data-based systems. You might use another form of authentication, or another server API altogether, but
    as long as they are compatible with RDF and SPARQL, they should be somewhat compatible.

    When working with Solid, I want to present all libraries presented on this website. Again I've implemented the
    same demo, but this time with the twist that it retrieves and updates the name that's retrieved from your WebID
    resource. This introduces some latency between client and server, and you'll experience some loading states when
    retrieving and submitting data.
